# OneNodeToFeedThemAll
Application to gather posts from your RSS channels and Twitter.

Unfortunately FB doesn't allow fetching posts you normally see on your wall, but you can authenticate with Facebook.

Application is using MEAN stack ( Mongo, Express 4, Angular, Node.js ) with Passport for authentication, Mongoose as ODM, Twit, Restler and Feedparser for fetching external data, Mocha + Chai + Sinon + Mockgoose for testing and many, many more.
